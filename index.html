    <ul id="firstList">
      <li>If today were the last of your life, would you do what you were going to do today?</li>
      <li>I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love.</li>
      <li>When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: ‘If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.’ It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘no’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</li>
      <li>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle.</li>
      <li>Almost everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure, these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.</li>
      <li>Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</li>
      <li>Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.</li>
      <li>There is no reason not to follow your heart.</li>
    </ul>
